**Best way to learn JS is to practice it!**

### Each File is a Program

- Almost every Web Application has a bunch of JS files.
- In JS, every single file is its own separate program. So, if somehow one file fails, it won't affect the execution of the other files.
- The only way multiple JS files act as a single program is by sharing their state via the **"global scope"**.
- Since ES6, JS started supporting **Modules** format.
